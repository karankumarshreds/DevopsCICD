## Benifits of pipelines

- CODE: Written in code and is stored in the version control as scripts

- RESILIENT: Can survive jenkins restarts

- PAUSABLE: Like waiting for manual approval (similar to AWS code pipeline)

- VERSATILE: Can have logical implementation

- VISUAL: For better visualization of the workflow
